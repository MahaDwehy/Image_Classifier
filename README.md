# Image_Classifier
In this project, I'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. In practice I trained this classifier, then export it for use in the application. I'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) from Oxford of 102 flower categories.
