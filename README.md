# Image_Classifier
In this project, I'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. In practice I trained this classifier, then export it for use in the application. I'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) from Oxford of 102 flower categories.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

* Load the image dataset and create a pipeline.
* Build and Train an image classifier on this dataset.
* Use the trained model to perform inference on flower images.


When I've completed this project, I'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images.
